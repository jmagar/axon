# axon

Spider-powered self-hosted RAG engine — scrape, map, extract, crawl, embed, and query indexed content via the MCP `axon` tool or the `axon` CLI.

Backed by Qdrant (hybrid dense + BM42 sparse + RRF), TEI for embeddings, optional Chrome (headless) for JS-heavy sites, and a configurable LLM backend for `ask`, `research`, and extract fallback. Gemini headless is the default; OpenAI-compatible endpoints such as llama.cpp are supported with `AXON_LLM_BACKEND=openai-compat`.

## Installation

```bash
claude plugin install <path>
```

The plugin manifest declares a minimal `userConfig` block. Claude Code prompts for the shared Axon server URL, bearer token, optional Tavily/GitHub/Reddit credentials, and optional OAuth settings. Qdrant, TEI, Chrome, Qwen3 embedding, and LLM backend settings are configured by the shared Docker setup path, not by plugin prompts.

The SessionStart hook invokes `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/axon setup plugin-hook` directly. The binary owns the full hook setup flow, including mapping the `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_*` plugin options to its `AXON_*` env vars before loading config:

1. Map plugin options (server URL, bearer token, Tavily/GitHub/Reddit credentials, OAuth settings) to `AXON_*` env vars.
2. Run `axon setup plugin-hook`.
3. Let the binary perform check-first repair and classify blocking setup failures separately from advisory smoke/prewarm failures.
4. Preserve existing `~/.axon/.env` and `~/.axon/config.toml`; setup only fills missing runtime values.

**Already-healthy fast path:** before doing any of the above setup work, the hook
probes `/readyz` once (3s) at the configured bind (`AXON_MCP_HTTP_HOST`/`AXON_MCP_HTTP_PORT`
from `~/.axon/.env`, default `127.0.0.1:8001`). Because `/readyz` asserts qdrant +
tei readiness, a success means the stack is already deployed — the hook then exits
`0` silently (no preflight, no `compose pull`/`up`, no stdout in human mode). It only
runs the full setup path when `/readyz` is unreachable. This keeps session start
quiet on running hosts while still auto-deploying a genuinely-down stack.

No systemd unit is created, and the plugin-cache binary is not symlinked into `~/.local/bin`. Docker Compose is the only production deployment target. The `.mcp.json` connects Claude Code to `${user_config.server_url}/mcp` with the configured bearer token.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/axon-deploy [up\|restart\|rebuild]` | Explicit on-demand deploy/restart/rebuild of the stack (`axon compose …` + `axon doctor`). The manual counterpart to the now-silent SessionStart hook. |

`~/.axon` is the canonical appdata root for plugin deployments too. Keep `~/.axon/.env`, `~/.axon/config.toml`, jobs, artifacts, output, logs, and service data there.

## MCP Server

Single tool: `mcp__axon__axon`. Routed by `action` plus an optional `subaction` for lifecycle families.

```json
{ "action": "doctor" }
{ "action": "scrape", "url": "https://example.com" }
{ "action": "ask", "query": "How does axon handle Chrome auto-switching?" }
{ "action": "crawl", "subaction": "status", "job_id": "<uuid>" }
```

Response envelope:

```json
{ "ok": true, "action": "...", "subaction": "...", "data": { ... } }
```

Default `response_mode: "path"` writes large outputs under the configured Axon appdata root (default `~/.axon/artifacts`) and returns a compact `shape` summary plus an artifact pointer. See the `axon` skill for the full action map.

## Skills (16)

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `axon` | Meta-skill: full action map and routing guide |
| `ask` | RAG: retrieve + LLM-synthesized answer with citations |
| `crawl` | Recursive site crawl (async by default) |
| `doctor` | Service health check (Qdrant / TEI / Chrome / Tavily / LLM) |
| `domains` | Indexed domains summary |
| `embed` | Embed local files / dirs / URLs into Qdrant |
| `extract` | LLM-powered structured data extraction |
| `ingest` | GitHub / Reddit / YouTube / AI-session ingestion |
| `map` | URL discovery (sitemap-first, anchor-fallback, no fetch) |
| `query` | Pure semantic vector search (no LLM) |
| `retrieve` | Fetch all chunks indexed for a specific URL |
| `scrape` | Single-URL or small-batch scrape to markdown |
| `search` | Tavily web search; auto-queues crawl for results |
| `sources` | List indexed URLs with chunk counts |
| `stats` | Qdrant collection statistics |
| `status` | Job queue snapshot |

## Agents

- `researcher` — autonomous discover → fetch → embed → synthesize pipeline. Invoked when the index lacks coverage on a topic and the user wants a grounded, cited answer.

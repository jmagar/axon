# Ask-quality regression gate.
#
# The required test names are checked before running focused filters. This
# closes the silent-pass hole: `cargo test <filter>` exits 0 when the filter
# matches nothing, so a renamed/deleted test would let the gate go green while
# asserting nothing.
#
# CI invokes `--verify-only` after the broad nextest run has already executed
# these tests. That keeps the explicit named-test guard without re-entering
# Cargo test a second time.
#
# NOTE: four former filters were removed because their target tests/functions
# do not exist in the tree (they matched zero tests and were silently passing):
#   - ask_quality_regression_fixtures_five_queries
#   - procedural_query_requires_official_docs_citation
#   - config_schema_query_requires_exact_page_citation
#   - authoritative_allowlist_matches_exact_and_suffix_hosts
# These represent intended coverage (citation grounding, authoritative-host
# allowlisting, a five-query fixture set) that should be authored as a
# follow-up — together with the underlying allowlist/policy code they assert.
# Do NOT re-add a filter here until the matching test exists, or the guard
# will (correctly) fail the gate.

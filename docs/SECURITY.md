## 1. Scope and Threat Model

This document captures the security controls present in the Axon code base today. Axon is a single-binary Rust application (`axon`) with SQLite-backed jobs and in-process workers. The legacy Postgres / Redis / AMQP runtime has been removed. MCP HTTP auth supports static bearer mode and Google OAuth/JWT mode through lab-auth.

**In scope:**

- SSRF via user-supplied URLs (CLI args, MCP tool calls, sitemap/discovered URLs)
- DNS rebinding against the in-process HTTP client
- Secret leakage through commits, logs, and `Debug` impls
- MCP HTTP transport authentication and origin/host validation
- Local admin web panel access control
- Heap exposure from the optional ask full-document cache in long-lived
  `serve`/`mcp` processes

**Out of scope:**

- Host kernel compromise
- Multi-tenant isolation — Axon is designed for trusted self-hosted operation
- Hardening of the upstream services Axon talks to (Qdrant, TEI, Gemini headless LLM)
- Supply-chain integrity beyond pinned crate versions

---

## 2. SSRF and URL Validation

### 2.1 `validate_url()`

Source: `src/core/http/ssrf.rs:64`.

`validate_url(&str) -> Result<(), HttpError>` is the parse-time SSRF guard. It rejects:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Non-HTTP schemes | `file://`, `gopher://`, `ftp://`, `javascript:` |
| Loopback hosts | `localhost`, `*.localhost` |
| Reserved TLDs | `*.internal`, `*.local` |
| Loopback IPs | `127.0.0.0/8`, `::1`, `0.0.0.0/8` |
| Link-local | `169.254.0.0/16`, `fe80::/10` |
| RFC 1918 private | `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16` |
| IPv6 unique-local | `fc00::/7` |
| IPv4-mapped IPv6 | `::ffff:127.0.0.1`, `::ffff:10.x.x.x` (recursed into the v4 checks) |

Implementation note: hosts are parsed with `host_str().parse::<IpAddr>()`, **not** `spider::url::Host::Ipv4/Ipv6` — the spider variants silently miss IPv6 (confirmed production bug, see `src/core/CLAUDE.md`).

### 2.2 Call sites

`validate_url()` is invoked at every external entry point that accepts a URL. As of this writing, callers include (`src/core/http/client.rs:46,70` and):

- `src/cli/commands/scrape.rs`, `crawl.rs`, `screenshot.rs`
- `src/services/scrape.rs`, `map.rs`, `screenshot.rs`
- `src/crawl/engine/map.rs`, `engine/sitemap.rs`, `scrape.rs`, `screenshot.rs`
- `src/jobs/lite/workers/runners/crawl.rs`, `src/jobs/crawl.rs`
- `src/ingest/youtube.rs`, `ingest/github/files/clone.rs`, `ingest/github/wiki.rs`
- `src/mcp/server/common.rs`
- `src/core/content/engine.rs`

The reqwest redirect policy also re-validates every redirect target (`src/core/http/client.rs:44-53`). A 30x to a blocked URL becomes `PermissionDenied` instead of a follow.

### 2.3 DNS rebinding (TOCTOU) — mitigated

`validate_url()` only checks literal hostnames and IPs. The connect-time TOCTOU window is closed by `SsrfBlockingResolver` (`src/core/http/ssrf.rs:174-205`), wired into the reqwest client via `ClientBuilder::dns_resolver()` in production builds. The resolver runs `check_ip()` on every IP returned by the OS resolver at the moment reqwest dials. A TTL-0 record that flips to `127.0.0.1` after `validate_url()` returns is rejected before the connection is made.

Test builds (`#[cfg(test)]`) skip the custom resolver so `httpmock` servers on `127.0.0.1` remain reachable; `validate_url()` itself still blocks loopback unless a thread-local `ALLOW_LOOPBACK` flag is set inside the test.

### 2.4 Defence-in-depth blacklist

`ssrf_blacklist_patterns()` (`src/core/http/ssrf.rs:144`) returns 12 regex patterns covering loopback, link-local, RFC-1918, and IPv6 private ranges. These are passed to `spider`'s `with_blacklist_url()` so URLs **discovered during crawl** (sitemaps, link extraction) are dropped before fetch — even if the seed URL was public, a crawler cannot follow a same-page link to `http://127.0.0.1/admin`.

---

## 3. HTTP Client Safety

Source: `src/core/http/client.rs`.

- Production builds use a single shared `LazyLock<reqwest::Client>` (`HTTP_CLIENT`), constructed once with a 30-second timeout and the SSRF-blocking DNS resolver. **Never construct `reqwest::Client::new()` per call** — that bypasses the resolver and exhausts sockets under load.
- The redirect policy re-validates every hop with `validate_url()` (`client.rs:44`).
- `fetch_html()` validates the final URL before issuing the request (`client.rs:70`).
- Test builds get a fresh leaked `reqwest::Client` per call to avoid cross-runtime "dispatch task is gone" failures and to keep `httpmock` working.

The shared User-Agent resolves in priority order: `AXON_USER_AGENT` → `AXON_CHROME_USER_AGENT` → built-in Firefox browser UA (`DEFAULT_UA` in `src/core/http/ua.rs`). All HTTP paths — the `http_client()` singleton, Spider crawl/scrape/screenshot paths, and vertical extractors — use this resolved value consistently. Reddit ingestion uses its own OAuth-format UA regardless of these settings.

---

## 4. MCP HTTP Authentication

The MCP server (`axon mcp`) supports `stdio`, `http`, and `both` transports. **Stdio is unauthenticated** and relies on OS process boundaries — the MCP client owns the process lifecycle. HTTP is gated by static bearer auth, OAuth, or loopback-only dev mode.

Sources: `src/mcp/auth.rs`, `src/mcp/server/http.rs`.

### 4.1 Auth policies

| Policy | How selected | Behavior |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| OAuth/JWT | `AXON_MCP_AUTH_MODE=oauth` | Builds `lab_auth::state::AuthState`, mounts OAuth routes, validates JWT bearer tokens, and enforces `axon:read` / `axon:write` scopes. |
| Bearer-only | default mode with `AXON_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN` set | Validates a static token with `lab_auth::AuthLayer::with_static_token`; static tokens receive both read and write scopes. |
| Loopback dev | default mode, no token, loopback bind | No auth layer; loopback bind is the trust boundary. |

Static bearer tokens are accepted on either header:
- `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- `x-api-key: <token>` (normalized to bearer before lab-auth sees the request)

Empty or whitespace-only `AXON_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN` values are treated as unset.

### 4.2 OAuth mode

When `AXON_MCP_AUTH_MODE=oauth`, `src/mcp/auth.rs` initializes lab-auth with
Google OAuth, JWKS/JWT validation, dynamic client registration, and OAuth
metadata routes. `AXON_MCP_PUBLIC_URL`, Google client credentials, and admin
email are required. `AXON_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN` remains valid in dual mode when set.

OAuth mode reads `AXON_MCP_PUBLIC_URL`, `AXON_MCP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`,
`AXON_MCP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `AXON_MCP_AUTH_ADMIN_EMAIL`, and
`AXON_MCP_AUTH_ALLOWED_REDIRECT_URIS`. The OAuth router exposes
`/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`, `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`,
`/jwks`, `/authorize`, `/auth/google/callback`, `/token`, and `/register`.

### 4.3 Startup policy

`build_auth_policy` (`src/mcp/auth.rs`) runs before the listener binds:

| Bind host | Auth configured | Behaviour |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Stdio transport | any | loopback/process-boundary policy; OAuth config is ignored with a warning |
| Loopback (`127.0.0.1`, `::1`, `localhost`) | OAuth or static token | start, auth required |
| Loopback | none | start, log a warning, requests pass through |
| Non-loopback (`0.0.0.0`, public DNS) | OAuth or static token | start, auth required |
| Non-loopback | none | **refuse to start** with a clear error |

This means a forgotten token on a public bind fails closed instead of running unauthenticated.

### 4.4 Scope enforcement

Mounted auth inserts `lab_auth::AuthContext` into request extensions. `src/mcp/server.rs` maps each tool action to a minimum scope:

- `axon:write`: mutating operations such as `crawl`, `extract`, `embed`, `ingest`, `scrape`, and artifact deletion/cleanup.
- `axon:read`: query, search, retrieval, status, ask/research/evaluate, screenshots, and read-only artifact operations.
- `axon:write` satisfies `axon:read`; unknown actions fail closed.

See `docs/auth/MCP-AUTH.md` for the canonical, code-aligned auth flow.

---

## 5. Host and CORS Allowlists

The MCP HTTP server stacks host and CORS middleware around the MCP router. When `AuthPolicy` is mounted, `lab_auth::AuthLayer` protects `/mcp`; OAuth routes are mounted beside it and remain unauthenticated so the OAuth flow can start.

### 5.1 Host validation

Source: `src/web/security.rs` (used by `src/mcp/server/http.rs:23-26`).

`HostAllowlist` accepts:

- `127.0.0.1:<port>`, `localhost:<port>`, `[::1]:<port>`
- The configured bind host on its port
- Every entry in `AXON_MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (origin → authority via `Uri::authority()`)

Requests with a `Host` header outside that set return `403 forbidden: host not allowed`. Missing `Host` returns `400`.

### 5.2 CORS

Source: `src/mcp/cors.rs` (mounted by `server/http.rs:148-151`).

- Allowlist driven by `AXON_MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (comma-separated). Unset = strict default (only same-origin / loopback). Non-browser tools (curl, MCP SDKs) are unaffected because they do not send `Origin`.
- Preflight `OPTIONS` requests with a disallowed origin return `403`.
- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` is the **static** list `authorization, content-type, x-api-key`. The middleware never reflects the client-supplied `Access-Control-Request-Headers` value, which would grant an effective wildcard (CWE-942).

---

## 6. Web Admin Panel

Source: `src/web/auth.rs`, `src/web/server.rs`.

`apps/web` (`@axon/admin-panel`) is an admin-only setup/config UI mounted by `axon serve`. It is **not** a public-facing application.

- On first start, `init_panel_password()` (`auth.rs:33`) generates a 32-byte URL-safe password, writes it to `~/.axon/panel-password` with mode `0600` and `O_NOFOLLOW`, and prints it once to stderr. Existing files are reused.
- `/api/panel/login` accepts the password and returns it back to the caller as a session token. `/api/panel/state` is unauthenticated (returns only `setup_required` + the config path).
- All other `/api/panel/*` routes require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` or `x-axon-panel-token: <token>`, verified in constant time via `PanelPassword::verify` (`auth.rs:21-26`).
- Routes exposed: `state` (GET), `login` (POST), `config` (GET/PUT), `ops` (GET), `setup/targets` (GET). There is no shell endpoint, no WebSocket, no download route, no `/output/*` route in the current code.

Recommendations:

- Bind the unified `axon serve` to `127.0.0.1` unless you intend to expose the panel externally.
- If exposing externally, terminate TLS and add a reverse-proxy auth layer in front — the panel password is meant for local administration.

## 7. Secrets Handling

### 7.1 `~/.axon/.env` is the only secret store

- Service URLs and credentials live in `~/.axon/.env`. Repo-local `.env` is a gitignored development fallback only. `.env.example` is the tracked template.
- `~/.axon/config.toml` is for **non-secret** tuning knobs only (search params, worker limits). The loader treats unknown fields as fatal so accidentally pasting a secret there fails fast (`src/core/config/parse/toml_config.rs`).
- The MCP HTTP static token is `AXON_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN`; OAuth/JWT mode is configured with the `AXON_MCP_*` auth variables documented above.

### 7.2 `Debug` redaction

`Config`'s `fmt::Debug` impl (`src/core/config/types/config_impls.rs:203-369`) redacts:

- `github_token`
- `reddit_client_id`, `reddit_client_secret`
- `tavily_api_key`
- `custom_headers` — values redacted, header names preserved as `"Name: [REDACTED]"`; malformed entries become `"[MALFORMED]"`

Do **not** add new secret fields without extending this impl. The compiler will not warn you.

### 7.3 Logging hygiene

- Library code uses `log_info` / `log_warn` / `log_done` from `src/core/logging.rs`. Never `println!` from a library — it bypasses log targets and rotation.
- `redact_url()` in `src/core/content.rs` strips `username:password@` from URLs before logging.
- The MCP server returns deterministic error messages and never echoes secret env values back to callers.

### 7.4 Ask full-document cache

The optional `[ask.cache]` cache stores full-document Qdrant chunks in the
process heap for the ask retrieval path. Cached values include `chunk_text`;
logs deliberately omit that text and only use source identifiers and counters.

The cache is disabled by default and is useful only in long-lived `axon serve`
or `axon mcp` processes. When enabled for those modes, startup enforces
`RLIMIT_CORE=0` before initializing the daemon so a crash does not write cached
source text to a core file. This guard does not encrypt heap memory and does
not protect against a compromised process; it only removes the core-dump leak
path.

## 8. Network Exposure

| Service | Default bind | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| `axon mcp` / `axon serve` / Compose `axon` (HTTP) | `127.0.0.1:8001` | Non-loopback bind requires bearer or OAuth auth. Compose defaults to loopback publish via `AXON_MCP_HTTP_PUBLISH=127.0.0.1:8001`; set `0.0.0.0:8001` only intentionally. |
| `axon-qdrant` (compose) | `127.0.0.1:53333`, `:53334` | Loopback in `docker-compose.yaml`. |
| `axon-tei` (compose) | `127.0.0.1:52000` | Loopback. |
| `axon-chrome` (compose) | `127.0.0.1:6000`, `:9222`, `:9223` | Loopback. Ports: 6000 = `headless_browser` management API, 9222 = CDP proxy, 9223 = raw Chrome DevTools. **All three are unauthenticated control planes** and rely on the loopback bind for access control. |

Hardening guidance:

- Keep infra services loopback-bound. The compose file already does this; the `127.0.0.1:` prefix on every Chrome port mapping is intentional security posture, not a bug.
- For the MCP server on a non-loopback host, set a long random `AXON_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN` (`openssl rand -hex 32`) or configure `AXON_MCP_AUTH_MODE=oauth`.
- Never expose Qdrant or Chrome's CDP / management ports to a network. The upstream `headless_browser` and Chrome DevTools Protocol have **no built-in authentication** — anyone who can reach 6000/9222/9223 can run arbitrary JS, navigate to internal URLs, exfiltrate cookies from any origin Chrome has visited, and (via `Page.navigate` on `file://` URLs) read local files inside the container.

Cross-host deployments (operator-managed):

- If you point `chrome_remote_url` in `~/.axon/config.toml` at a non-loopback host (for clients running on a different machine than `axon-chrome`), **you own the auth boundary** — front the Chrome ports with an authenticated reverse proxy, an SSH tunnel, a WireGuard mesh, or equivalent. Axon does not add a token to the CDP/management endpoints because those endpoints are owned by upstream crates we do not control.
- The defense-in-depth `validate_url()` SSRF guard still runs on every URL handed to Chrome via spider (`screenshot`, `extract`, `crawl`, `map`, `scrape`), so an attacker who tricks axon into asking Chrome to fetch `http://127.0.0.1:54321/admin` is blocked at the axon layer regardless of where Chrome is hosted.

---

## 9. Operational Checklist

Before deploy:

1. `~/.axon/.env` exists and contains every required secret. Repo-local `.env`, if present for development fallback, is not committed.
2. `git diff -- . ':!*.lock'` shows no secret material in the changeset.
3. For history scans, run a dedicated tool (`gitleaks detect --source=. --log-opts="HEAD~50..HEAD"` or similar). `git diff` only sees uncommitted changes.
4. `AXON_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN` or OAuth mode is configured if `AXON_MCP_HTTP_HOST` is anything other than `127.0.0.1` / `localhost` / `::1`.
5. `~/.axon/panel-password` exists and is mode `0600` if `axon serve` will run.
6. `./scripts/axon doctor` reports Qdrant and TEI healthy.

After deploy:

1. Containers report healthy.
2. `curl http://<host>:8001/mcp` (no auth) returns `401` when the token is configured.
3. `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <wrong>" http://<host>:8001/mcp` returns `401`.
4. Logs do not show repeated `web: rejected request with disallowed Host header` (indicates a misconfigured allowlist) or token-auth failures from your own clients.

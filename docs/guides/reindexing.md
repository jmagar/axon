# Re-index Guide: Schema v3-v6 Payload Upgrade

This guide explains what changed in Qdrant payload schema versions 3 through 6, who needs to
re-index existing points, and how to do it efficiently and safely.

The current schema version is **6** (`PAYLOAD_SCHEMA_VERSION = 6` in
`src/vector/ops/qdrant/utils.rs`). Every point written by `axon` today carries
`payload_schema_version = 6`. Versions 3 and 4 were introduced on 2026-05-21, v5 added
origin tracking, and v6 adds code-symbol metadata for GitHub file chunks.

---

## What Changed in Schema v3

Schema v3 was introduced on 2026-05-21. Points written before that date are version 1 or 2
and do not have the new fields.

### New: canonical `git_*` provider fields

All git-backed ingest sources (`github`, `gitlab`, `gitea`, `git`) now emit a uniform set
of flat, indexed fields. Previously, GitHub ingest used ad-hoc `gh_*` fields; GitLab,
Gitea, and generic git had their own inconsistent layouts.

| Field | Indexed | Example values |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| `provider` | yes | `"github"` \| `"gitlab"` \| `"gitea"` \| `"git"` |
| `git_host` | yes | `"github.com"`, `"gitlab.com"`, `"codeberg.org"` |
| `git_owner` | yes | org/user/namespace |
| `git_repo` | yes | repository name |
| `git_content_kind` | yes | `"file"` \| `"issue"` \| `"pr"` \| `"release"` \| `"wiki"` \| `"repo_metadata"` |
| `git_state` | yes | `"open"` \| `"closed"` \| `"merged"` \| absent |
| `git_number` | yes | issue or PR number |
| `git_author` | yes | login/username |
| `git_file_language` | yes | file language/extension for file chunks |
| `git_branch` | no | default or cloned branch |
| `git_labels` | no | labels array |
| `git_is_draft` | no | PR draft status |
| `git_created_at` | no | ISO8601 creation timestamp |
| `git_updated_at` | no | ISO8601 update timestamp |
| `git_merged_at` | no | ISO8601 merge timestamp |
| `git_file_path` | no | relative file path for file chunks |
| `git_meta` | no | provider-specific extras (not indexed) |

Queries that were previously GitHub-only (`gh_*`) can now target all git providers
uniformly. For example, filtering `git_content_kind = "issue"` returns issues from
GitHub, GitLab, and Gitea in a single search.

The legacy `gh_*` fields on existing GitHub points are backwards-compatible aliases and
will be removed after a confirmed full re-index.

### New: vertical extractor `extra` payload fields

Vertical extractors (`github_repo`, `npm`, `pypi`, `crates_io`, `huggingface_model`,
`stackoverflow`, `hackernews`, `arxiv`, `dev_to`, `reddit`, etc.) now emit additional
indexed fields that enable source-specific filtering:

| Field | Extractors |
|-------|------------|
| `pkg_registry`, `pkg_name`, `pkg_language`, `pkg_license`, `pkg_author` | npm, pypi, crates_io, docs_rs |
| `hf_task`, `hf_library` | huggingface_model |
| `so_question_id`, `so_is_answered` | stackoverflow |
| `hn_type`, `hn_author` | hackernews |
| `arxiv_id` | arxiv |
| `devto_author` | dev_to |

These fields are absent on points written before schema v3.

---

## What Changed in Schema v4

Schema v4 (also 2026-05-21) **promoted** a set of GitHub repo fields out of the
non-indexed `git_meta` blob and into indexed top-level payload keys, and removed those keys
from `git_meta`. The promoted, now-indexed fields are:

| Field | Qdrant type | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| `gh_stars` | integer | Stargazer count at ingest time |
| `gh_forks` | integer | Fork count at ingest time |
| `gh_language` | keyword | Primary repo language |
| `gh_topics` | keyword[] | GitHub topics array |
| `gh_is_fork` | bool | Whether the repo is a fork |
| `gh_is_archived` | bool | Whether the repo is archived |
| `gh_file_type` | keyword | `"source"` \| `"test"` \| `"config"` \| `"doc"` |
| `gh_line_start` | integer | First line of a code chunk (1-indexed) |
| `gh_line_end` | integer | Last line of a code chunk (1-indexed) |

On v1–v3 GitHub points these values were either absent or buried inside the unindexed
`git_meta` blob, so you could not filter or facet on them. v4 makes them queryable. See the
full contract in [`docs/reference/qdrant-payload-schema.md`](../reference/qdrant-payload-schema.md)
— GitHub-specific fields.

These fields are written only by the GitHub ingest path, so only GitHub points benefit from
a v4 re-index; GitLab/Gitea/generic-git/vertical/crawl points gain nothing new at v4 beyond
the version stamp.

## What Changed in Schema v5

Schema v5 added the indexed top-level `seed_url` field. This is the origin that started
the chunk's acquisition: the crawl start URL for crawls, the ingest target for ingest jobs,
or the document URL for direct embed/scrape paths. `axon refresh` facets on this field to
re-enqueue previously indexed origins.

Points indexed before v5 do not participate in refresh origin discovery until they are
re-indexed.

## What Changed in Schema v6

Schema v6 adds code declaration metadata for GitHub file chunks:

| Field | Indexed | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `chunking_method` | yes | Restored write of `"tree_sitter"` or `"prose"` for GitHub file chunks. |
| `symbol_name` | no | Declaration name when known, e.g. `"Response::parse"`. Stored for retrieval, not indexed. |
| `symbol_kind` | yes | Low-cardinality declaration kind such as `"function"`, `"method"`, `"struct"`, `"const"`, or `"type"`. |

GitHub code chunks also changed boundaries because doc comments, duplicate capture cleanup,
qualified names, tiny declaration merging, and oversized-declaration header injection all
operate before embedding. This means a full GitHub re-ingest is required to backfill symbol
metadata on existing code points.

---

## Who Needs to Re-index

Re-indexing is **optional but recommended** for anyone who wants to filter or facet on
the new v3 fields against data that was indexed before 2026-05-21.

You specifically benefit from re-indexing if you:

- Query GitHub, GitLab, Gitea, or generic git ingest points and want to filter by
  `git_content_kind`, `git_file_language`, `git_author`, `git_state`, or `git_owner`.
- Use `axon refresh` and want older sources to be discoverable via `seed_url`.
- Query GitHub code and want to filter by `symbol_kind` or inspect `symbol_name` /
  `chunking_method` in retrieved chunks.
- Query vertical extractor points (npm, PyPI, Crates.io, HuggingFace, etc.) and want to
  filter by package or model metadata fields.
- Run any query that would return mixed results and you want to scope to a specific
  provider or content kind.

If you only do semantic similarity search (`axon query` / `axon ask`) without payload
filters, existing points are unaffected and re-indexing has no impact on result quality.

## How to Identify Stale Points

### Check the version distribution

```bash
axon sources --by-schema-version
```

This scrolls the entire collection and counts points per `payload_schema_version`. Output
example:

```
Payload schema version breakdown
  v1 (chunks: 2841200)
  v2 (chunks: 612400)
  v3 (chunks: 200000)
  v4 (chunks: 140000)
```

The breakdown is a `BTreeMap<u32, usize>` keyed by version (points lacking the field are
tallied under `v1`); `--json` emits the same counts under `schema_version_breakdown`. This is
an O(N) full scroll — on a 3.79M-point collection it takes a few minutes. Run it once to get
your bearings, not on every startup.

### Check a specific source type

```bash
# Inspect stored chunks for a known GitHub source URL
axon retrieve https://github.com/org/repo --json | head
```

If the returned payloads lack `git_content_kind` (or, for the v4 fields, `gh_stars` /
`gh_file_type`), those points predate the corresponding schema version and would benefit from
re-ingest. (`axon query` does not take a payload `--filter`; use `retrieve` by URL to inspect a
specific source, or `sources --by-schema-version` for the collection-wide breakdown.)

---

## Re-indexing by Source Type

Re-ingesting a source overwrites existing points via Qdrant's upsert semantics when the
source URL and chunk index are stable. For GitHub file chunks, line ranges are part of the
stored URL (`#Lstart-Lend`), so boundary-shifting chunker changes require special cleanup.
Axon now deletes existing GitHub `file` points for the target repo up front, scoped by
`provider=github`, `git_owner`, `git_repo`, and `git_content_kind=file`, with `wait=true`
before embedding the current file set.

That up-front delete prevents orphaned old code chunks when line ranges move. The tradeoff:
if a GitHub file ingest is interrupted after the delete but before successful re-embedding
(for example, TEI is unavailable), that repo temporarily has zero file/code points until
the job is retried or recovered. Re-run the ingest, or use the job recovery flow, to restore
the repo's file corpus.

### Crawl and embed points

Re-crawl the original source URL:

```bash
axon crawl https://example.com/docs --wait true
```

Or for single pages:

```bash
axon scrape https://example.com/page
```

Crawl re-embeds every page it visits. Points for pages that no longer exist are not
removed automatically — run `axon dedupe` after if you want to clean those up.

### GitHub repositories

```bash
axon ingest https://github.com/org/repo --wait true
```

This re-ingests source files, issues, PRs, releases, and wiki pages. Each re-embedded
point carries the full v3 `git_*` field set and replaces the corresponding v1/v2 point.
For file chunks, Axon first removes the repo's prior GitHub file points with the scoped
wait-true delete described above, then writes the current file set with v6 symbol metadata.
Issues, PRs, releases, wiki pages, and repo metadata are not deleted by that file-point
cleanup.

`axon migrate` does not backfill v6 symbol metadata because it only transforms existing
Qdrant points and computes sparse vectors; it does not re-read source code or run the
chunker. Use `axon ingest https://github.com/org/repo --wait true` for symbol backfill.

### GitLab projects

```bash
axon ingest https://gitlab.com/group/project --wait true
```

Same semantics as GitHub. v3 `git_*` fields are written by the GitLab ingest path
(`src/ingest/gitlab/`).

### Gitea / Forgejo / generic git

```bash
# Gitea/Forgejo
axon ingest https://codeberg.org/owner/repo --wait true

# Generic HTTPS git (bare clone, source files only)
axon ingest git:https://git.example.com/owner/repo.git --wait true
```

### Reddit subreddits and threads

```bash
axon ingest r/rust --wait true
axon ingest https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/abc123/post_title/ --wait true
```

Reddit ingest writes flat `reddit_*` fields. These haven't changed between v2 and v3, but
re-ingesting is the only way to get `payload_schema_version = 3` stamped on those points.

### YouTube videos, playlists, and channels

```bash
axon ingest https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID --wait true
axon ingest https://www.youtube.com/channel/CHANNEL_ID --wait true
```

YouTube ingest writes flat `yt_*` fields. Same situation as Reddit — unchanged fields,
but re-ingest updates the schema version stamp.

### AI session exports

```bash
axon sessions --wait true
```

Sessions are re-indexed from the export files in your configured sessions directory.
Session points (`claude_session`, `codex_session`, `sessions`) have no v3-specific fields,
so re-indexing these is low priority.

---

## Prioritization

Re-indexing takes time — on a 3.79M-point collection, a full re-index is a multi-hour
background operation. Focus on the highest-value sources first.

| Priority | Source | Reason |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **Highest** | GitHub / GitLab repos you actively query by content kind, file language, or author | `git_content_kind`, `git_file_language`, `git_state` filters require v3; GitHub repo facets (`gh_stars`, `gh_forks`, `gh_language`, `gh_topics`, `gh_is_fork`, `gh_is_archived`, `gh_file_type`) require v4 |
| **High** | npm / PyPI / Crates.io / HuggingFace verticals | Package metadata filters (`pkg_name`, `pkg_language`, `hf_task`) require v3 |
| **Medium** | Reddit / Hacker News ingest | Per-community faceting; fields unchanged but version stamp is wrong |
| **Low** | Generic crawl/embed points | No new filterable fields; re-crawl only if content has changed |
| **Skip** | AI session exports | No v3-specific fields; version stamp only |

Run re-indexing with `--wait false` (the default) to enqueue jobs in the background and
continue working:

```bash
axon ingest https://github.com/org/repo-a
axon ingest https://github.com/org/repo-b
axon ingest https://github.com/org/repo-c
axon status  # monitor job queue
```

---

## Upsert Semantics: No Orphan Cleanup Needed

Point IDs in axon are **deterministic UUID v5** hashes derived from `url` and
`chunk_index`. Re-ingesting the same source always produces the same point IDs — Qdrant's
upsert operation overwrites the old payload in place.

This means:

- **No duplicates.** A re-ingest of `github.com/org/repo` overwrites every existing
  chunk for that repo. You will not end up with two copies.
- **No manual delete step.** There is no need to delete old points before re-ingesting.
- **Stale-tail cleanup is automatic.** If a file that previously had 10 chunks now has 6
  (because content was removed), the 4 orphan chunks (`chunk_index 6–9`) are deleted
  automatically after a successful upsert. This is handled by `qdrant_delete_stale_tail()`
  in the embed pipeline.
- **`axon dedupe` is optional.** Run it after crawl re-indexing if you suspect
  near-duplicate chunks from page reorganizations, but it is not required for correctness.

---

## Estimated Scope

The user collection has approximately **3.79M points** as of 2026-05-21.

| Scenario | Estimated time |
|----------|---------------|
| Single GitHub repo (small, ~500 files, ~50 issues) | 2–5 minutes |
| Single GitHub repo (large, ~5,000 files, ~2,000 issues) | 20–40 minutes |
| Full crawl of a mid-size docs site (~2,000 pages) | 10–30 minutes |
| All priority GitHub/GitLab repos (10–20 repos) | 2–8 hours (background) |
| Full collection re-index (all sources) | Multi-day background task |

The full collection re-index is not blocking and does not need to be done all at once.
Newly indexed points are immediately queryable with v3 filters; old points continue to
serve semantic search results without interruption. The collection is always live — there
is no maintenance window or read blackout during re-indexing.

## Quick-Start Checklist

```bash
# 1. See your current version distribution
axon sources --by-schema-version

# 2. Re-index your highest-priority GitHub repos (background jobs)
axon ingest https://github.com/org/repo-1
axon ingest https://github.com/org/repo-2

# 3. Monitor progress
axon status

# 4. Verify v3 points are appearing
axon sources --by-schema-version   # v3 count should grow

# 5. Optionally clean up near-duplicates after crawl re-indexing
axon dedupe
```

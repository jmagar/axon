## Scope

This is the operator runbook for local/homelab operation of Axon.

## Day 0 Prerequisites

### Recommended: automated bootstrap

Run `scripts/dev-setup.sh` once. It handles all of steps 1–4 automatically:

```bash
./scripts/dev-setup.sh
```

What the script does: installs system tools and Rust toolchain, installs `just` and `lefthook`, sets up Node.js and pnpm, creates `.env` from `.env.example`, auto-generates secrets (Postgres, Redis, RabbitMQ, web API token), prompts for `AXON_DATA_DIR` (default `~/.local/share/axon`), pre-creates all volume-mount directories, backfills test infrastructure URLs, and starts both production and test Docker infrastructure.

After the script completes, edit `.env` and fill in any remaining `CHANGE_ME` values:

- `TEI_URL` — external text embedding service
- `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_MODEL` — LLM endpoint
- `TAVILY_API_KEY` — required for `search` and `research` commands

See `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` for a full description of all env vars including ACP and test infrastructure variables.

### Manual bootstrap (alternative)

1. Copy env template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Populate required values in `.env`:

- Postgres credentials and `AXON_PG_URL`
- Redis password and `AXON_REDIS_URL`
- RabbitMQ credentials and `AXON_AMQP_URL`
- `QDRANT_URL`
- `TEI_URL`
- `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_MODEL`
- `AXON_WEB_API_TOKEN` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_AXON_API_TOKEN` (must be equal)

3. Ensure Docker and Compose are healthy.

4. Pre-create data directories:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/axon/axon/{postgres,redis,rabbitmq,qdrant,output,artifacts}
```

## Day 1 Startup

> **Local dev mode**: Workers and the web frontend run as local processes, not in Docker. Only infrastructure runs via Compose.

### Infrastructure (Docker)

```bash
docker compose up -d axon-postgres axon-redis axon-rabbitmq axon-qdrant axon-chrome
docker compose ps
```

### Workers (local processes)

**All at once (recommended):**

```bash
just workers
```

This starts crawl, embed, extract, ingest, and refresh workers in parallel with a shared exit trap.

**Or each in its own terminal or tmux pane:**

```bash
cargo run --bin axon -- crawl worker
cargo run --bin axon -- embed worker
cargo run --bin axon -- extract worker
cargo run --bin axon -- ingest worker
cargo run --bin axon -- refresh worker
```

### Web frontend (local process)

```bash
cd apps/web && pnpm dev    # → http://localhost:49010
```

### Full dev stack (all-in-one)

```bash
just dev
```

Starts infra, all workers, the axum serve process, MCP server, shell server, and Next.js dev server. `Ctrl+C` cleanly stops all spawned processes.

### Verify service reachability

```bash
./scripts/axon doctor
```

### Tail worker output

Workers run in the foreground locally — output goes to the terminal directly. For infra containers:

```bash
docker compose logs -f axon-postgres axon-redis axon-rabbitmq axon-qdrant
```

## Health Checks

Expected healthy Docker containers (infra only):

- `axon-postgres`
- `axon-redis`
- `axon-rabbitmq`
- `axon-qdrant`
- `axon-chrome`

Workers and web frontend are local processes — verify they are running in their respective terminals (or via `just workers`).

Quick checks:

```bash
docker compose ps
./scripts/axon status
```

If any are unhealthy, inspect logs before restart.

## Daily Operations

### Run crawl/scrape

```bash
./scripts/axon scrape https://example.com --wait true
./scripts/axon crawl https://docs.rs/spider --wait false
```

### Ingest sources

The `github`, `reddit`, and `youtube` ingest commands were unified into `axon ingest` in v0.12.0. The target type is auto-detected:

```bash
./scripts/axon ingest owner/repo            # GitHub repo (slug or github.com URL)
./scripts/axon ingest https://github.com/owner/repo
./scripts/axon ingest r/subreddit           # Reddit subreddit
./scripts/axon ingest https://reddit.com/r/subreddit
./scripts/axon ingest https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID   # YouTube video
./scripts/axon ingest https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=...  # YouTube playlist
./scripts/axon ingest https://www.youtube.com/@channel           # YouTube channel
```

### Track async progress

```bash
./scripts/axon status
./scripts/axon crawl list
./scripts/axon crawl status <job_id>
./scripts/axon ingest list
./scripts/axon ingest status <job_id>
```

### Query/RAG

```bash
./scripts/axon query "vector search"
./scripts/axon ask "what did we index for X?"
```

## Incident Playbooks

### Jobs stuck in `pending`

1. Confirm worker processes are running (check your terminal/tmux pane or `just workers` output).

2. Confirm AMQP and DB reachable:

```bash
./scripts/axon doctor
```

3. Restart all workers — kill each process and re-run:

```bash
# All at once:
just workers

# Or individually (each in its own terminal):
cargo run --bin axon -- crawl worker
cargo run --bin axon -- embed worker
cargo run --bin axon -- extract worker
cargo run --bin axon -- ingest worker
cargo run --bin axon -- refresh worker
```

### Jobs stuck in `running`

1. Trigger manual recover:

```bash
./scripts/axon crawl recover
./scripts/axon extract recover
./scripts/axon embed recover
./scripts/axon ingest recover
```

2. If repeated, inspect worker logs and watchdog configuration.

### Pulse/API returning 503

Cause: missing LLM env vars in web runtime.

Required:

- `OPENAI_BASE_URL`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`

Also needed for retrieval features:

- `TEI_URL`
- `QDRANT_URL`

### ACP sessions not starting

Check:

- `AXON_ACP_MAX_CONCURRENT_SESSIONS` — if at limit (default 8), sessions will be rejected until existing ones complete
- `AXON_ACP_ADAPTER_CMD` (or agent-specific override) — must point to a valid adapter binary
- `AXON_ACP_AUTO_APPROVE` — if `false`, tool calls require explicit approval; unexpected for automated flows

## Job Queue Operations

Runbook commands:

```bash
./scripts/axon crawl list
./scripts/axon crawl errors <job_id>
./scripts/axon crawl cancel <job_id>
./scripts/axon crawl cleanup
```

Same pattern applies to `extract`, `embed`, and `ingest`.

## Data and Storage Hygiene

Persistent data roots are under `${AXON_DATA_DIR}/axon/...`:

- Postgres data
- Redis appendonly data
- RabbitMQ data
- Qdrant storage
- Worker output and logs
- MCP artifacts (`${AXON_DATA_DIR}/axon/artifacts` when `AXON_MCP_ARTIFACT_DIR` is set)

Cleanup caution:

- `clear` and aggressive cleanup commands are destructive.
- Use `list` and `status` first.

Cache and build-context guardrails:

```bash
# inspect local target/ + BuildKit cache sizes
just cache-status

# enforce size thresholds (prunes incremental/target and/or BuildKit cache)
just cache-prune

# run live Docker context-size probe for axon-workers + axon-web
just docker-context-probe
```

Threshold tuning (optional):

- `AXON_TARGET_MAX_GB` (default `30`)
- `AXON_BUILDKIT_MAX_GB` (default `120`)
- `AXON_WORKERS_CONTEXT_MAX_MB` (default `500`)
- `AXON_WEB_CONTEXT_MAX_MB` (default `100`)
- `AXON_CONTEXT_PROBE_TIMEOUT_SECS` (default `30`)

`scripts/rebuild-fresh.sh` runs cache guard + context probe automatically unless disabled:

- `AXON_AUTO_CACHE_GUARD=false`
- `AXON_ENFORCE_DOCKER_CONTEXT_PROBE=false`

### Test infrastructure data

Test containers use a separate `docker-compose.test.yaml` and store data in ephemeral volumes. Destroy test data with:

```bash
just test-infra-down    # stops containers and wipes volumes
just test-infra-up      # start fresh
```

## Logs and Diagnostics

Primary logs:

```bash
docker compose logs -f axon-workers
docker compose logs -f axon-rabbitmq
docker compose logs -f axon-qdrant
```

Structured app logs are written under mounted logs volume for workers.

Chrome diagnostics:

- controlled by `AXON_CHROME_DIAGNOSTICS*` env vars
- output directory defaults to configured diagnostics path

## Safe Shutdown

Graceful shutdown:

```bash
docker compose down
```

If draining is needed first:

1. Stop new submissions.
2. Monitor active jobs with `status`.
3. Cancel remaining long-running jobs if required.
4. Bring stack down.

To stop only local worker processes started with `just workers` or `just dev`, use `Ctrl+C` in the terminal running them — the EXIT trap kills all spawned processes cleanly.

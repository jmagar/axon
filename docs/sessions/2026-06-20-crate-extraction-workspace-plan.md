# Crate extraction workspace plan

## User Request

Explore transitioning Axon into a proper Rust workspace with reusable crates for chunking, embedding, vector-store/upsert, retrieval, API contracts, adapters, and app surfaces. Produce a complete plan first, run an engineering review, apply the review recommendations to the beads, and save the session to markdown.

## Session Overview

Created and reviewed the Beads epic for extracting Axon from one primary Rust crate into a multi-crate workspace. The plan remains implementation-ready but now carries explicit review guardrails for `/v1/actions`, job-runner boundaries, security invariants, generated-client parity, and final dependency-feature gates.

## Sequence of Events

1. Discussed target crate granularity and decided the core reusable crates should include chunking, embedding, vector-store/upsert, retrieval, content/crawl/ingest/jobs, services, API, CLI, MCP, and web adapters.
2. Created the plan-first Beads epic `axon_rust-23dw` with 17 child beads and an 11-wave dependency graph.
3. Ran `lavra-eng-review` against the plan and identified missing or under-specified acceptance criteria.
4. Added review comments to the epic, then updated the epic and all 17 child beads with review-driven notes.
5. Validated the swarm graph and saved this session artifact.

## Key Findings

- The migration is not a simple directory move. The main preparatory work is cycle-breaking around `services -> mcp`, `vector -> services`, `jobs -> services`, and small upward `core` dependencies.
- `/v1/actions` must be tracked as a first-class product surface alongside CLI, MCP, REST/web, Android, Tauri, and Chrome extension clients.
- `axon-jobs` needs an explicit runner boundary before extraction: jobs should own queue/state/payload/worker mechanics, while services or domain crates register handlers.
- Auth and URL-safety behavior are high-risk extraction seams: MCP/Web auth warnings, unauthenticated response envelopes, and SSRF/DNS-aware validation need explicit preservation.
- Generated clients under `apps/` need verification as part of API and web extraction, not as a late cleanup afterthought.

## Technical Decisions

- No separate tests crate: tests should move with the crate that owns the behavior, with cross-crate integration coverage kept at the workspace level.
- `axon-api` is an early extraction because neutral DTOs and generated-client contracts are needed to break services/MCP coupling.
- `axon-auth` and `axon-observability` remain earned crates: the beads now allow an explicit no-extract decision if the boundary would only add ceremony.
- Compatibility re-exports and temporary shims should be used during moves, then removed only after downstream crates compile.
- Final feature profiles must be proven with `cargo tree -e features` and duplicate/heavy dependency checks before being documented.

## Repository Maintenance

### Plans

Scanned `docs/plans/` and `docs/plans/complete/`. No plan file was moved because this session created tracker planning work rather than completing an existing checked-in plan file. Several historical plans remain active-looking or ambiguous and were left untouched.

### Beads

Updated the directly relevant epic and all 17 child beads. Did not close any beads because the implementation work has not started and all child beads remain open by design.

### Worktrees and branches

Inspected worktrees and branches. No worktree or branch cleanup was performed. The active branch is `codex/crawl-memory-boundaries`; additional worktrees exist for `marketplace-no-mcp` and `codex/lumen-style-code-search`, and both have explicit branch ownership or long-lived context.

### Stale docs

No stale docs were edited. The relevant stale-doc issue is now captured in `axon_rust-23dw.1`, which requires the first implementation bead to document which older workspace plans are stale and why.

### Transparency

Existing dirty files were observed before writing this artifact: a renamed session doc and a modified Rust config literal file. They were not touched by this session and must not be included in the session-log commit.

## Tools and Skills Used

- Shell commands: used `bd`, `git`, `gh`, `date`, `test`, and repository listing commands to inspect state, update beads, and validate the graph.
- Beads CLI: created and updated the workspace extraction epic and child beads, added review comments, and validated swarmability.
- Skills: used `lavra-plan`, `lavra-eng-review`, and `vibin:save-to-md`.
- Memory: prior Axon memory informed the engineering review, especially the recurring `/v1/actions` parity risk.
- No browser automation or external web search was used.

## Commands Executed

| command | result |
|---|---|
| `bd show axon_rust-23dw --json` | Read the epic and confirmed notes/comments/child bead state |
| `bd list --parent axon_rust-23dw --json` | Read the 17 child beads |
| `bd update axon_rust-23dw.* --append-notes ...` | Added review-driven notes to all child beads |
| `bd update axon_rust-23dw --append-notes ...` | Added the epic-level recommendation summary |
| `bd comments add axon_rust-23dw ...` | Added review comments for `/v1/actions`, jobs runner boundary, and security invariants |
| `bd swarm validate axon_rust-23dw` | Passed: 17 issues, 11 waves, max parallelism 3, first ready bead `axon_rust-23dw.1` |
| `git status --short` | Showed pre-existing dirty rename and Rust source modification |
| `git worktree list --porcelain` | Confirmed active and sibling worktrees |
| `gh pr view --json number,title,url` | Confirmed active PR #246 |

## Errors Encountered

- Transcript discovery was noisy because the requested save skill is Claude-session oriented while this work happened in Codex. No clean transcript path was used in the metadata.
- `test -e docs/sessions/2026-06-20-crate-extraction-workspace-plan.md` returned nonzero as expected, confirming the target artifact did not already exist.

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)

| area | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| Tracker plan | Crate extraction plan existed with 17 child beads | Epic and all child beads now include engineering-review guardrails |
| `/v1/actions` | Mentioned indirectly through services/action API context | Required as a first-class surface in inventory/API/services/web/adapters |
| Jobs extraction | Required `jobs -> services` inversion | Requires an explicit runner-boundary design before moving code |
| Security invariants | Mentioned in scattered relevant beads | Explicitly required for auth, crawl, content, MCP, and web beads |
| Runtime behavior | No code behavior changed | No runtime behavior changed; tracker-only planning update |

## Verification Evidence

| command | expected | actual | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bd swarm validate axon_rust-23dw` | Epic remains valid and executable | Passed: 17 issues, 11 waves, max parallelism 3 | pass |
| `bd show axon_rust-23dw --json` | Epic notes and child bead notes reflect review amendments | Output showed epic notes and amended child bead notes | pass |
| `git status --short` | Only pre-existing dirty files plus this generated artifact before commit | Pre-existing dirty rename/source change observed; generated artifact added by save pass | warn |

## Risks and Rollback

- Risk: Bead notes are tracker data, not a code diff, so rollback should use `bd update` to replace or clear the appended notes if the plan direction changes.
- Risk: Existing dirty files could be accidentally committed if broad staging is used. The save workflow must stage and commit only this session artifact path.
- Rollback: remove or amend `docs/sessions/2026-06-20-crate-extraction-workspace-plan.md` with a path-limited commit, and use Beads history or explicit `bd update` calls to revise the tracker notes.

## Decisions Not Taken

- Did not begin code extraction. The first implementation bead is still `axon_rust-23dw.1`.
- Did not create a tests crate. Ownership stays with behavior crates and workspace integration tests.
- Did not move any docs/plans files to `complete/` because none was conclusively completed by this session.
- Did not clean branches or worktrees because active ownership and long-lived branch context were observed.

## Open Questions

- The first inventory bead still needs to decide whether `axon-auth` and `axon-observability` become real crates or remain adapter-owned seams.
- The exact job-runner boundary shape is intentionally deferred to `axon_rust-23dw.11`.
- The final public API stability level for each reusable crate still needs to be documented after the inventory and first extractions.

## Next Steps

1. Start with `bd update axon_rust-23dw.1 --claim`.
2. Produce the checked-in workspace extraction inventory document.
3. Confirm `/v1/actions`, generated clients, manifest ownership, and security invariants in that inventory before moving source files.
4. Then proceed to `axon_rust-23dw.2` for `axon-api`.

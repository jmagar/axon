# Idempotent bootstrap for axon's Incus deployment.
#
# Architecture: HYBRID, not all-Docker. Only axon-tei, axon-chrome, and
# (default mode) axon-qdrant run as nested-Docker containers inside the Incus
# container. The axon binary itself runs natively via systemd
# (axon-native.service) directly on the Incus container's own OS — no
# container image is built or shipped for axon. This avoids the build/publish
# overhead of a Docker image for a binary that already runs fine as a native
# process on the same OS family as the Incus container (Debian, x86_64,
# matching dookie's host arch — no cross-compilation needed). See
# deploy/incus/README.md for the full rationale.
#
# Usage:
#   deploy/incus/bootstrap.sh [default|external-qdrant]
#
# default mode:          bundled qdrant starts alongside tei/chrome; axon
#                        (native) points at the bundled qdrant.
# external-qdrant mode:  requires AXON_EXTERNAL_QDRANT_URL; bundled qdrant is
#                        not started, axon (native) points at the external
#                        instance instead.
#
# Safe to re-run at any time (idempotent). Also the intended entry point for
# the companion systemd unit (axon-incus-bootstrap.service) that re-runs this
# on every host boot, since boot.autostart=true alone does not re-apply the
# known-fragile nvidia-procfs device, re-verify GPU access, or rebuild/restart
# the native axon binary.

### 1. Profile: create from the committed definition if missing. Never
### overwrite an existing profile — live edits during development are
### intentional and this script must not clobber them.

### 5c. Build + install the axon binary natively — skip the rebuild if a
### binary already installed reports the same version as this checkout's
### Cargo.toml (keeps re-runs fast; a version bump or explicit force forces

### clone) so the container never needs its own git credentials.

### and re-enabling an already-enabled unit is a no-op).

### 6. Re-apply the nvidia-procfs device. REQUIRED ON EVERY RUN — confirmed
### (bead axon_rust-4m749.2) this does not reliably survive a container
### stop/start cycle, silently breaking nested-Docker GPU passthrough until
### removed and re-added.

### 7. Fail-closed GPU verification BEFORE anything GPU-dependent starts.
### Do not start TEI in a broken/CPU-fallback state — refuse and exit instead.
### Pull the verification image once, outside the retry loop — otherwise a
### cold image cache turns each retry into a registry pull-and-run, which

incus file push -r "$REPO_ROOT/config" "$CONTAINER_NAME$DEPLOY_PATH/"

### 9. Ensure the external Docker network exists (idempotent — compose
### requires this to pre-exist since docker-compose.prod.yaml declares it
### `external: true`). The real network name comes from DOCKER_NETWORK in the
### env file (defaults to "axon") — must match compose's own resolution
### exactly, not be hardcoded, since a deployment can override it (e.g.
### dookie's existing ~/.axon/.env sets DOCKER_NETWORK=jakenet). Reuse the
### repo's own env-file parser (handles quoting/comments/export prefix
### correctly) instead of a one-off grep, in a subshell so it doesn't leak
### the whole env file into this script's environment.

# This deployment specifically relies on a non-default DOCKER_NETWORK value
# (dookie's ~/.axon/.env sets jakenet) — a silently-swallowed parse failure
# here would fall through to the "axon" default and misroute the whole stack
# onto the wrong bridge with no visible error. Surface it instead.

### 10. [removed] A prior version of this step computed a checksum of the
### files this same script had just pushed in step 8 and compared it against
### the last run's checksum — which can never differ, since step 8
### unconditionally overwrites the container's copy with the host's current
### copy on every run. That made it a no-op that logged a reassuring message
### without ever being able to detect anything, which is worse than no check
### at all (a future reader could mistake it for real drift detection). The
### memory-headroom check in step 11 is this script's actual fail-closed
### gate; if genuine tamper-evidence for the deployed config is needed later,
### it needs to compare a HOST-side hash (computed before step 8's push, from
### a value stored outside this script's own write path) — not container-side
### state this script itself just wrote.

### 11. Memory-headroom check before starting bundled qdrant. This is the
### mandatory gate — dookie has a real, documented qdrant OOM-crashloop
### history; a config-integrity checksum alone would not have caught it.

  fi
  log "memory headroom check passed (${avail_gb}GB available)"
fi

### 12. Push the env-file and start the stack — --env-file is ALWAYS explicit,
### no reliance on Compose's implicit .env-in-cwd behavior. Push with
### --mode 0600 directly (not push-then-chmod as a separate step) — the
### latter leaves the secrets file at incus file push's default mode for the
### window between the two commands, readable by anything else in the same
### container in the meantime.
incus file push --mode 0600 "$env_file_on_host" "$CONTAINER_NAME$DEPLOY_PATH/.env"
# The axon service's own `env_file:` directive (compose, not the CLI flag
# above) reads from ${AXON_HOME}/.env — which resolves to /mnt/axon-data/.env
# once AXON_HOME is overridden below. Keep that copy in sync too (same
# secrets file, two paths compose needs it at — see README for why the
# split exists).
incus file push --mode 0600 "$env_file_on_host" "$CONTAINER_NAME/mnt/axon-data/.env"

# The shared ~/.axon/.env carries host-native paths meant for bare-host/
# local-dev use (e.g. AXON_HOME=/home/jmagar/.axon, GEMINI_HOME resolving off
# a bare-host $HOME) and may set AXON_IMAGE for a manually-tagged local build.
# None of that is valid *inside* this Incus container, where data actually
# lives at the mounted /mnt/axon-data and /mnt/axon-gemini — force the
# correct values explicitly rather than trust whatever's in the shared file.
# (Also: `incus exec` runs as root by default, so an unset $HOME-relative
# default would resolve against /root, not /home/axon — another reason these
# must be explicit, not left to the compose file's own fallback.)
#
# Passed via `incus exec --env`/`--cwd` flags, not interpolated into an
# `sh -c` string — this value (AXON_EXTERNAL_QDRANT_URL) comes from a
# trusted operator-authored env file today, but string interpolation into a
# root-executed shell command is a shape worth avoiding even when the current
# threat model doesn't require it: a stray single quote would otherwise
# splice arbitrary content into the command.

### Only the sidecar services run via docker compose here — axon itself runs
### natively (step 5c/5d above), so it is deliberately excluded from the `up
### -d` service list even though docker-compose.prod.yaml still defines an
### `axon` service (that definition is for bare-host/non-Incus deployments).
### AXON_HOME is still needed here: axon-tei and axon-qdrant's volume mounts
### resolve off it. GEMINI_HOME/AXON_IMAGE are not — those only apply to the
### now-excluded `axon` service definition.

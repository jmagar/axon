//! SSH/SFTP client bridge for the Files view's remote-browsing feature.
//!
//! # Registration gate
//!
//! The `#[tauri::command]`s in this module are NOT added to `lib.rs`'s
//! `invoke_handler!` until `sftp_known_hosts.rs`'s host-key verification
//! (see that module) is implemented and its always-accept regression test
//! passes. This is deliberate: it is impossible to accidentally ship a live,
//! callable SFTP command surface with `check_server_key` stubbed to
//! unconditionally accept any host key, because until that lands, nothing in
//! the frontend can reach these commands at all.
//!
//! # Threat model
//!
//! Unlike `files_bridge.rs`'s local root-escape checks, there is no local
//! canonicalization concept for a remote server's filesystem — the SFTP
//! server itself is the authority on what paths exist and are reachable.
//! What SFTP *does* need, that local files don't, is host-key verification
//! (MITM protection — see `sftp_known_hosts.rs`) and credential handling
//! (`private_key_path`, which — unlike remote paths — IS a local file and
//! DOES need the same local-path rigor as `files_bridge.rs`; see
//! `validate_private_key_path` below).

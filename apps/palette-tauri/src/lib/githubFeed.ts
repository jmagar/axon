// Cross-repo activity Feed — types and pure presentation helpers.
//
// `FeedItem` mirrors `src-tauri/src/github_feed.rs::FeedItem` field-for-field
// (camelCase because that Rust struct is `#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]`,
// same convention as `GitHubBrowseResult` in actionRequest.ts). Grouping by
// day happens here, not in Rust — it's a presentation concern (depends on the
// viewer's "now," which the bridge has no reason to know about), matching how
// the reference mock also grouped its (fixture) feed data client-side.
//
// Data source: GitHub's Events API, fanned out per-repo by the Rust bridge —
// see docs/plans/palette-github-enhancements.md's "Data source decision"
// section for why this was chosen over the Notifications API.
//
// Kind taxonomy verified against palette-mock.html's real `var FEED_KIND =
// {...}` object: pr/merge/review/comment/conflict/deps/issue/push/release.
// `comment` and `conflict` are registered here for forward-compatibility but
// `github_feed.rs::normalize_event` never emits them in this pass (no clean
// Events API source — see Task 3's "Mock-verified taxonomy" note).
